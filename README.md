### k nearest Neighbour  
The k nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented in Java from scratch. It can be used either with a training set and a separate test set or just one set with a specified percentage to use for testing.
Please make sure that only valid CSV files, i.e. commas as delimiters and dots as decimal separators, are passed as arguments.

The submitted zip contains all files necessary to build and run the algorithm. Please navigate to the kNN folder and type `ant` to execute the Ant build file and create the runnable jar. Afterwards you can type
```
java -jar kNN.jar pathToTrainingSet pathToTestSet header k
```
to run the program with two separate sets or type
```
java -jar kNN.jar pathToDataset header percentage k seed
```
to start it with just one set.

* **pathTo*Set:** Specifies the path to the dataset(s) relative to the current directory.
* **header:** Boolean variable specifying whether the dataset contains a header row with attribute names. If you use the program with a separate testing set, this value is applied to both sets.
* **percentage:** Percentage of the whole dataset to use for testing.
* **k:** Number of neighbors used for classification.
* **seed:** The seed used to select the test set. This is not necessary when using a separate test set.

**The last column of the set will always be chosen as the class label.**

To reproduce the results that were discussed in the report in section X.X.X  ... To be continued.
